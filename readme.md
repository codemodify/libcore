# ![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/materialiconsoutlined/flare/v4/24px.svg) libCore

> - A set of basic building blocks carefully designed to work well together for C
> - A micro-framework approach designed with efficiency and minimal code and binary size in mind
> - Style and error reporting heavily inspired from Go
> - It is desinged to be included into a project (not link against) by inlcuding the blocks of desired funtionality
> - Think of it as a lego, combine blocks as you see fit, code and binary size is under complete control without unwanted dependencies
> - Runs on a wide range devices, starting from ultra-low powered IoT platforms
> - Clean, robust, simple to read C code, emphasizes no spaghetties of `#ifdefs`
